  """Returns a WSGI app that serves static files.

  Args:
    url_re: A url-matching regex as specified in appinfo.URLMap.
    files_mapping: A static_files definition as specified in appinfo.URLMap.
      May include a regex backref. See the appinfo.URLMap docstring
      for more information.
    upload_re: A filename-matching regex as specified in appinfo.URLMap.
      Only files that match this regex will be served regardless of other
      arguments.
    mime_type: A mime type to apply to all files. If absent,
      mimetypes.guess_type() is used.
    http_headers: dictionary of header keys and values.
    expiration: String of form 'Xd Yh Zs' as public documentation states.

  Returns:
    A static file-serving WSGI app closed over the inputs.
